# Angle 01 — Yoga/Taffy/Stretch

## Claims (with confidence)

- Claim (high): Yoga, Taffy, and Stretch all use **measure functions** (callbacks) on leaf nodes to delegate intrinsic sizing to external systems (text engines, image loaders, etc.). The layout engine never hard-codes how to measure content -- it asks. Yoga's C signature: `YGSize (*YGMeasureFunc)(YGNodeRef node, float width, YGMeasureMode widthMode, float height, YGMeasureMode heightMode)`. Taffy's closure receives `known_dimensions: Size<Option<f32>>`, `available_space: Size<AvailableSpace>`, `node_id`, `node_context`, and `style`.

- Claim (high): Yoga enforces that **only leaf nodes** (nodes with no children) can have measure functions. A node with a measure function cannot have children -- Yoga asserts on this. This means the tree is split cleanly: branch nodes use flexbox to size children, leaf nodes use measure functions to report intrinsic size. This is the architectural pattern iLoveReact's layout.lua would need to adopt.

- Claim (high): Yoga passes **three MeasureMode values** to the measure callback per axis: **Exactly** (use this exact size, analogous to stretch-fit), **AtMost** (return up to this size, analogous to fit-content), and **Undefined** (return your natural/max-content size, no upper bound). These three modes are sufficient to express all the constraint scenarios flexbox needs from leaf nodes.

- Claim (high): Taffy models available space with three enum variants: **Definite(f32)** (known pixel budget), **MinContent** (lay out as small as possible), and **MaxContent** (lay out as large as content wants). Taffy additionally passes `known_dimensions` where `Some(width)` means "assume this width is fixed, tell me the height" -- enabling **width-dependent-height** queries critical for text wrapping.

- Claim (high): Yoga does **not** support `min-content` sizing constraints for performance reasons (expensive for text nodes). It uses `max-content` for intrinsic item size calculations instead. This is a deliberate trade-off documented in the CSS Grid PR for Yoga.

- Claim (medium): The measure function is called **as few times as possible** by Yoga -- ideally once per leaf per layout pass. Yoga caches results and skips measurement when a node already has a definite dimension. The dirty-marking system (`YGNodeMarkDirty`) propagates up to ancestors when content changes, triggering re-measurement only where needed.

- Claim (medium): **LuaJIT FFI bindings for Yoga exist** (`lyoga` by Planimeter) with precompiled shared libraries. This means replacing iLoveReact's hand-rolled Lua layout engine with Yoga via FFI is technically feasible, though iLoveReact uses QuickJS (not LuaJIT), so the FFI path would require C bindings rather than LuaJIT's FFI.

- Claim (medium): Taffy has **work-in-progress WASM bindings** (PR #394) that could theoretically be consumed from QuickJS if compiled to a shared library, but this is not production-ready and would require significant integration work.

- Claim (medium): The **width-dependent-height** problem (text wrapping) is the hardest part of intrinsic sizing. Yoga's approach is to call the measure function with a constrained width (AtMost mode) and let the text engine report the resulting height. This is effectively a two-pass pattern: first determine width constraints from flexbox, then query the leaf for height given that width.

- Claim (low): Stretch (the predecessor to Taffy) is **unmaintained** and had known bugs with leaf nodes and measure functions. It evolved through stretch2 into Taffy. Stretch should not be considered for new integrations.

## What I'm unsure about

- **Exact caching strategy**: How many times Yoga actually calls the measure function in practice during a single layout pass for complex trees. The docs say "ideally once" but real-world numbers for deep trees are not well-documented publicly.
- **QuickJS + Yoga integration path**: Whether Yoga's C API can be cleanly called from QuickJS via its C module system, or whether a custom bridge would be needed. lyoga targets LuaJIT FFI specifically, not plain Lua or QuickJS.
- **Taffy's actual maturity for non-Rust consumers**: The WASM bindings are WIP (PR #394). Whether they are stable enough for production use in 2026 is unclear from public sources.
- **Performance characteristics of measure callbacks across FFI boundaries**: If layout.lua were replaced by Yoga-via-FFI, each text measurement would cross Lua->C->Lua boundaries. Whether this is faster or slower than the current pure-Lua approach with explicit sizing is unknown without benchmarking.
- **How Yoga handles the "Box with no intrinsic width" problem specifically**: The docs focus on leaf node measurement. For intermediate containers (like a row Box), Yoga determines size from children's intrinsic sizes + flex rules. The exact algorithm for propagating intrinsic sizes upward through container nodes is not fully documented in public-facing materials -- it lives in the ~3000-line C++ implementation.
- **Whether Yoga's "no min-content" trade-off** would cause visible layout differences vs. web CSS for iLoveReact's use cases.
