The native renderer uses a three-segment flex layout (active track, thumb, inactive track) rather than absolute positioning for compatibility with the Lua layout engine.","api":"```tsx\r\nimport { Slider } from '@ilovereact/core';\r\n```\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst [volume, setVolume] = useState(0.5);\r\n\r\n<Slider\r\n  value={volume}\r\n  onValueChange={setVolume}\r\n  minimumValue={0}\r\n  maximumValue={1}\r\n  step={0.1}\r\n  style={{ width: 200 }}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProps:\r\n| Prop             | Type                          | Default     | Description                                |\r\n|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|\r\n| value            | number                        | undefined   | Controlled value (overrides internal state)|\r\n| defaultValue     | number                        | 0           | Initial value for uncontrolled mode        |\r\n| onValueChange    | (value: number) => void       | undefined   | Called on every value change during drag    |\r\n| onSlidingStart   | () => void                    | undefined   | Called when drag begins                    |\r\n| onSlidingEnd     | (value: number) => void       | undefined   | Called when drag ends with final value     |\r\n| minimumValue     | number                        | 0           | Minimum allowed value                      |\r\n| maximumValue     | number                        | 1           | Maximum allowed value                      |\r\n| step             | number                        | undefined   | Snap value to step increments              |\r\n| disabled         | boolean                       | false       | Disable interaction                        |\r\n| style            | Style                         | undefined   | Container style (width sets track length)  |\r\n| trackColor       | Color                         | '#333333'   | Inactive track color                       |\r\n| activeTrackColor | Color                         | '#4A90D9'   | Active (filled) track color                |\r\n| thumbColor       | Color                         | '#ffffff'   | Thumb color                                |\r\n| thumbSize        | number                        | 20          | Thumb diameter in pixels                   |\r\n| trackHeight      | number                        | 4           | Track height in pixels                     |\r\n| vertical         | boolean                       | false       | Vertical orientation                       |","examples":[{"title":"Basic horizontal slider","code":"```tsx\r\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(50);\r\n\r\n<Slider\r\n  value={value}\r\n  onValueChange={setValue}\r\n  minimumValue={0}\r\n  maximumValue={100}\r\n  style={{ width: 300 }}\r\n/>\r\n<Text style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>{`Value: ${value}`}</Text>\r\n```","platforms":["love2d","web"]},{"title":"Stepped slider with custom colors","code":"```tsx\r\nconst [rating, setRating] = useState(3);\r\n\r\n<Slider\r\n  value={rating}\r\n  onValueChange={setRating}\r\n  minimumValue={1}\r\n  maximumValue={5}\r\n  step={1}\r\n  trackColor=\"#45475a\"\r\n  activeTrackColor=\"#a6e3a1\"\r\n  thumbColor=\"#a6e3a1\"\r\n  thumbSize={24}\r\n  trackHeight={6}\r\n  style={{ width: 250 }}\r\n/>\r\n<Text style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>{`Rating: ${rating}/5`}</Text>\r\n```","platforms":["love2d","web"]},{"title":"Uncontrolled slider with callbacks","code":"```tsx\r\n<Slider\r\n  defaultValue={0.5}\r\n  minimumValue={0}\r\n  maximumValue={1}\r\n  onSlidingStart={() => console.log('started')}\r\n  onValueChange={(v) => console.log('current:', v)}\r\n  onSlidingEnd={(v) => console.log('final:', v)}\r\n  style={{ width: 200 }}\r\n/>\r\n```","platforms":["love2d","web"]},{"title":"Vertical slider","code":"```tsx\r\nconst [level, setLevel] = useState(0.7);\r\n\r\n<Box style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', gap: 12, height: 200 }}>\r\n  <Slider\r\n    value={level}\r\n    onValueChange={setLevel}\r\n    vertical\r\n    style={{ height: 180 }}\r\n    activeTrackColor=\"#89b4fa\"\r\n  />\r\n  <Text style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>{`${Math.round(level * 100)}%`}</Text>\r\n</Box>\r\n```","platforms":["love2d","web"]},{"title":"Disabled slider","code":"```tsx\r\n<Slider\r\n  value={0.3}\r\n  disabled\r\n  style={{ width: 200 }}\r\n/>\r\n```","platforms":["love2d","web"]}],"platformNotes":{"Love2D":"Native mode uses a three-segment flex row layout: active track segment, thumb circle, inactive track segment.

Your src/ directory is a standard TypeScript/React project. Install packages\r\nwith `npm install` and import them normally. The esbuild bundler resolves and bundles\r\nnpm dependencies into the output.\r\n\r\nNote: For the Love2D target, the bundle runs inside QuickJS, which has no Node.js\r\nAPIs (no fs, no http, no child_process). Pure JavaScript packages work. Packages\r\nthat depend on Node.js built-ins will not work in Love2D native mode but will work\r\nin web mode or grid targets (which run on Node.js).","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"How do I debug on Love2D?","code":"Q: How do I inspect my UI layout at runtime on Love2D?\r\n\r\nA: Press F12 to open the visual inspector.

The Lua runtime polls bundle.js every ~1 second.\r\nWhen it detects a change, it:\r\n  1. Reads dev state from JS (__getDevState)\r\n  2. Destroys the QuickJS context\r\n  3. Clears all Lua-side state (tree, images, animations, hover, focus)\r\n  4. Creates a new QuickJS context\r\n  5. Loads the new bundle\r\n  6. Injects cached dev state (__devState)\r\n  7.

The Style\r\ninterface is defined in TypeScript and supports a subset of CSS flexbox properties\r\nplus custom properties for the target renderers.\r\n\r\nIn web mode, Style objects are converted to React CSSProperties by the styleToCSS()\r\nfunction.

The measure.lua module loads fonts by (size, family, weight) and caches\r\nthem. When the layout engine encounters a Text node without explicit dimensions,\r\nit calls measureText() to get the intrinsic width and height based on the font\r\nmetrics and the available width constraint.\r\n\r\nOn web, the browser's own text measurement is used (via CSS).\r\n\r\nOn grid targets, text width equals the character count (monospace grids).","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"Can I mix targets?","code":"Q: Can I render the same component to multiple targets simultaneously?\r\n\r\nA: Each build is target-specific.

FadeInBox uses useAnimation to get an AnimatedValue and its current numeric\r\n   value. The timing animation runs once on mount, easing opacity from 0 to 1\r\n   over 1 second. The component re-renders only when the batched value changes.\r\n\r\n2. SpringBox uses the useSpring convenience hook. When the target value changes\r\n   (80 to 150 or back), a spring animation automatically starts. The stiffness\r\n   and damping parameters control the spring's feel (bouncy vs smooth).\r\n\r\n3. CompositeBox demonstrates parallel, sequence, and loop. First, X and Y\r\n   animations run in parallel (diagonal move). Then scale animates up and down\r\n   in sequence. The whole thing loops infinitely.\r\n\r\n4. TransitionBox uses CSS-style transitions. The transition property on the style\r\n   declares that backgroundColor should animate over 300ms with easeInOut easing.\r\n   The hoverStyle provides the target value. The Lua animate module handles\r\n   interpolation when the hover state changes (0-frame latency, no JS round-trip).\r\n\r\n5. PulseBox uses CSS-style keyframe animation. The animation property declares\r\n   keyframes at 0%, 50%, and 100%, with infinite iterations. The Lua animate\r\n   module runs this entirely on the Lua side, no React re-renders needed.\r\n\r\n6. Key performance insight: useAnimation and useSpring batch updates to animation\r\n   frames. AnimatedValue listeners fire every frame, but React state updates are\r\n   debounced. CSS-style animations (transition/animation) run entirely in Lua\r\n   without any React involvement."}},"counter":{"filePath":"examples/counter.txt","metadata":{"platforms":["all"],"keywords":["counter","state","useState","pressable","interactive","buttons","beginner"],"related":[],"difficulty":"beginner","title":"Interactive Counter","description":"A counter app with increment and decrement buttons using useState and Pressable","category":"Examples"},"sections":{"overview":"This example builds an interactive counter with two buttons.

When the user presses Enter,\r\n   onSubmit fires with the current text value. The input clears automatically.\r\n\r\n2. ScrollView wraps the todo list so it scrolls when items overflow the container.\r\n   It has flexGrow: 1 to fill remaining vertical space (the parent has height: '100%').\r\n\r\n3. Each TodoItem is a row (flexDirection: 'row') with three elements: a toggle\r\n   circle, the todo text (with flexGrow: 1 to fill space), and a remove button.\r\n\r\n4. The toggle circle uses conditional rendering: {todo.done && ...} to show a\r\n   checkmark only when the todo is completed.\r\n\r\n5. textDecorationLine: 'line-through' adds a strikethrough on completed todos.\r\n\r\n6. Unicode characters (\\u2713 for checkmark, \\u00d7 for multiplication sign)\r\n   are used for icons. In iLoveReact there are no icon fonts, so Unicode or\r\n   Image components are the icon options.\r\n\r\n7. State is managed with useState and useCallback.

In web mode it renders as a `<span>`; in native mode it outputs a `'Text'` host element for the Lua painter.","api":"```tsx\r\nimport { Text } from '@ilovereact/core';\r\n```\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n<Text style={{ fontSize: 16, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>\r\n  Hello, world\r\n</Text>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProps:\r\n| Prop          | Type                         | Default   | Description                              |\r\n|---------------|------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| style         | Style                        | undefined | Text styling (fontSize, color, etc.)     |\r\n| numberOfLines | number                       | undefined | Truncate text to N lines with ellipsis   |\r\n| onKeyDown     | (event: LoveEvent) => void   | undefined | Key pressed while focused                |\r\n| onKeyUp       | (event: LoveEvent) => void   | undefined | Key released while focused               |\r\n| onTextInput   | (event: LoveEvent) => void   | undefined | Text input while focused                 |\r\n| children      | ReactNode                    | undefined | Text content (strings, numbers, etc.)    |\r\n\r\nRelevant Style properties for Text:\r\n| Property           | Type                              | Description                              |\r\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| fontSize           | number                            | Font size in pixels (REQUIRED)           |\r\n| color              | Color                             | Text color                               |\r\n| fontFamily         | string                            | Font family name                         |\r\n| fontWeight         | 'normal' | 'bold' | number        | Font weight                              |\r\n| textAlign          | 'left' | 'center' | 'right'       | Horizontal text alignment                |\r\n| textOverflow       | 'clip' | 'ellipsis'               | How overflowing text is handled          |\r\n| textDecorationLine | 'none' | 'underline' | 'line-through' | Text decoration                    |\r\n| lineHeight         | number                            | Line height in pixels                    |\r\n| letterSpacing      | number                            | Extra space between characters            |\r\n| textShadowColor    | Color                             | Text shadow color                        |\r\n| textShadowOffsetX  | number                            | Text shadow horizontal offset            |\r\n| textShadowOffsetY  | number                            | Text shadow vertical offset              |","examples":[{"title":"Basic text","code":"```tsx\r\n<Text style={{ fontSize: 16, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>\r\n  Hello, world\r\n</Text>\r\n```","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"Styled heading","code":"```tsx\r\n<Text style={{\r\n  fontSize: 32,\r\n  fontWeight: 'bold',\r\n  color: '#89b4fa',\r\n  textAlign: 'center',\r\n  letterSpacing: 1.2,\r\n}}>\r\n  Dashboard\r\n</Text>\r\n```","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"Truncated text with numberOfLines","code":"```tsx\r\n<Box style={{ width: 200 }}>\r\n  <Text style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#a6adc8' }} numberOfLines={2}>\r\n    This is a long paragraph of text that will be truncated to two lines\r\n    with an ellipsis at the end if it overflows the available space.\r\n  </Text>\r\n</Box>\r\n```","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"Dynamic content with template literal","code":"```tsx\r\nconst count = 42;\r\n\r\n<Text style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>\r\n  {`Items: ${count}`}\r\n</Text>\r\n```","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"Text with shadow","code":"```tsx\r\n<Text style={{\r\n  fontSize: 24,\r\n  color: '#cdd6f4',\r\n  textShadowColor: [0, 0, 0, 0.5],\r\n  textShadowOffsetX: 2,\r\n  textShadowOffsetY: 2,\r\n}}>\r\n  Shadow Text\r\n</Text>\r\n```","platforms":["love2d","web"]}],"platformNotes":{"Love2D":"Renders as a 'Text' host element.

Your src/ directory is a standard TypeScript/React project. Install packages\r\nwith `npm install` and import them normally. The esbuild bundler resolves and bundles\r\nnpm dependencies into the output.\r\n\r\nNote: For the Love2D target, the bundle runs inside QuickJS, which has no Node.js\r\nAPIs (no fs, no http, no child_process). Pure JavaScript packages work. Packages\r\nthat depend on Node.js built-ins will not work in Love2D native mode but will work\r\nin web mode or grid targets (which run on Node.js).","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"How do I debug on Love2D?","code":"Q: How do I inspect my UI layout at runtime on Love2D?\r\n\r\nA: Press F12 to open the visual inspector.

The Lua runtime polls bundle.js every ~1 second.\r\nWhen it detects a change, it:\r\n  1. Reads dev state from JS (__getDevState)\r\n  2. Destroys the QuickJS context\r\n  3. Clears all Lua-side state (tree, images, animations, hover, focus)\r\n  4. Creates a new QuickJS context\r\n  5. Loads the new bundle\r\n  6. Injects cached dev state (__devState)\r\n  7. Triggers mount\r\n\r\nThis gives you near-instant reload without restarting Love2D.","platforms":["love2d"]},{"title":"What React version is required?","code":"Q: What version of React does iLoveReact use?\r\n\r\nA: React 18.3+ with react-reconciler 0.29.

The Style\r\ninterface is defined in TypeScript and supports a subset of CSS flexbox properties\r\nplus custom properties for the target renderers.\r\n\r\nIn web mode, Style objects are converted to React CSSProperties by the styleToCSS()\r\nfunction.

The measure.lua module loads fonts by (size, family, weight) and caches\r\nthem. When the layout engine encounters a Text node without explicit dimensions,\r\nit calls measureText() to get the intrinsic width and height based on the font\r\nmetrics and the available width constraint.\r\n\r\nOn web, the browser's own text measurement is used (via CSS).\r\n\r\nOn grid targets, text width equals the character count (monospace grids).","platforms":["all"]},{"title":"Can I mix targets?","code":"Q: Can I render the same component to multiple targets simultaneously?\r\n\r\nA: Each build is target-specific.

FadeInBox uses useAnimation to get an AnimatedValue and its current numeric\r\n   value. The timing animation runs once on mount, easing opacity from 0 to 1\r\n   over 1 second. The component re-renders only when the batched value changes.\r\n\r\n2. SpringBox uses the useSpring convenience hook. When the target value changes\r\n   (80 to 150 or back), a spring animation automatically starts. The stiffness\r\n   and damping parameters control the spring's feel (bouncy vs smooth).\r\n\r\n3. CompositeBox demonstrates parallel, sequence, and loop. First, X and Y\r\n   animations run in parallel (diagonal move). Then scale animates up and down\r\n   in sequence. The whole thing loops infinitely.\r\n\r\n4. TransitionBox uses CSS-style transitions. The transition property on the style\r\n   declares that backgroundColor should animate over 300ms with easeInOut easing.\r\n   The hoverStyle provides the target value. The Lua animate module handles\r\n   interpolation when the hover state changes (0-frame latency, no JS round-trip).\r\n\r\n5. PulseBox uses CSS-style keyframe animation. The animation property declares\r\n   keyframes at 0%, 50%, and 100%, with infinite iterations. The Lua animate\r\n   module runs this entirely on the Lua side, no React re-renders needed.\r\n\r\n6. Key performance insight: useAnimation and useSpring batch updates to animation\r\n   frames. AnimatedValue listeners fire every frame, but React state updates are\r\n   debounced. CSS-style animations (transition/animation) run entirely in Lua\r\n   without any React involvement."}},{"filePath":"examples/counter.txt","metadata":{"platforms":["all"],"keywords":["counter","state","useState","pressable","interactive","buttons","beginner"],"related":[],"difficulty":"beginner","title":"Interactive Counter","description":"A counter app with increment and decrement buttons using useState and Pressable","category":"Examples"},"sections":{"overview":"This example builds an interactive counter with two buttons.

When the user presses Enter,\r\n   onSubmit fires with the current text value. The input clears automatically.\r\n\r\n2. ScrollView wraps the todo list so it scrolls when items overflow the container.\r\n   It has flexGrow: 1 to fill remaining vertical space (the parent has height: '100%').\r\n\r\n3. Each TodoItem is a row (flexDirection: 'row') with three elements: a toggle\r\n   circle, the todo text (with flexGrow: 1 to fill space), and a remove button.\r\n\r\n4. The toggle circle uses conditional rendering: {todo.done && ...} to show a\r\n   checkmark only when the todo is completed.\r\n\r\n5. textDecorationLine: 'line-through' adds a strikethrough on completed todos.\r\n\r\n6. Unicode characters (\\u2713 for checkmark, \\u00d7 for multiplication sign)\r\n   are used for icons. In iLoveReact there are no icon fonts, so Unicode or\r\n   Image components are the icon options.\r\n\r\n7. State is managed with useState and useCallback. The functional update pattern\r\n   (prev => ...) ensures correct state transitions when events fire rapidly."}}]}
