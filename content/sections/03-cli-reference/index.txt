=== OVERVIEW ===
The ilovereact CLI is the primary tool for creating, developing, building, and testing
iLoveReact projects. It encodes correct esbuild flags, enforces lint gates before builds,
handles runtime file placement, and produces distribution packages. You should always use
the CLI instead of running raw esbuild commands directly -- manual esbuild will use wrong
flags, skip linting, and produce broken builds.

The CLI manages the distinction between framework files (lua/, lib/, ilovereact/) and
project-specific files (src/, main.lua, conf.lua). Framework files are synced from the CLI
runtime; project files are yours and never touched by CLI commands.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Available commands:

  ilovereact init <name>
    Create a new iLoveReact project.
    See: init.txt

  ilovereact dev
    Start esbuild in watch mode for live development.
    See: dev.txt

  ilovereact build [target] [flags]
    Bundle JS or produce distribution packages.
    Targets: (none), dist:love, dist:terminal
    Flags: --no-update, --debug
    See: build.txt

  ilovereact update
    Sync framework runtime files into the current project.
    See: update.txt

  ilovereact lint
    Run the static layout linter on src/ files.
    See: lint.txt

  ilovereact screenshot [--output path]
    Capture a headless screenshot of the current app.
    See: screenshot.txt

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Typical new project workflow
---
ilovereact init my-app
cd my-app
ilovereact dev
# In another terminal:
love .
---
Platforms: love2d

Example 2: Build and verify workflow
---
ilovereact lint
ilovereact screenshot --output /tmp/preview.png
ilovereact build dist:love
---
Platforms: love2d

Example 3: After framework changes
---
# In monorepo root:
make cli-setup
# In project directory:
cd examples/storybook
ilovereact update
ilovereact build
---
Platforms: All

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
The CLI currently covers Love2D scaffolding/builds and terminal distribution. For grid
target dev builds (terminal, CC, Neovim, Hammerspoon, AwesomeWM), use the npm scripts
in the root package.json -- these are the only cases where direct esbuild is appropriate.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Always use the CLI instead of running esbuild directly
- Run `ilovereact lint` after every component change
- Run `ilovereact screenshot` to visually verify layouts
- After editing framework source-of-truth files, run `make cli-setup` then `ilovereact update`
- Never edit cli/runtime/ or project lua/ilovereact/ directly -- those are disposable copies
