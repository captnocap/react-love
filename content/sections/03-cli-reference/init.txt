description: Create a new iLoveReact project with scaffolded structure and dependencies.
category: CLI
platforms: love2d
keywords: init, create, new project, scaffold, template, setup
related: dev.txt, build.txt, update.txt
difficulty: beginner

=== OVERVIEW ===
The `ilovereact init` command creates a new iLoveReact project directory with the complete
scaffolding needed to start development. It copies the project template, Lua runtime files,
native libraries, and framework source packages from the CLI runtime directory, writes a
package.json, and runs npm install.

After init completes, you can immediately start development with `ilovereact dev` and
`love .` in a second terminal.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Usage:
  ilovereact init <name>

Arguments:
  name    The project name. Creates a directory with this name in the current working directory.

What it creates:
  <name>/
    src/
      App.tsx          Starter application component
      main.tsx         Entry point (renders App into the reconciler)
    lua/               Lua runtime files (layout.lua, painter.lua, bridge_quickjs.lua, etc.)
    lib/
      libquickjs.so    QuickJS shared library for FFI bridge
    ilovereact/
      shared/          @ilovereact/core package source (primitives, hooks, animation)
      native/          @ilovereact/native package source (reconciler host config)
    main.lua           Love2D entry point
    conf.lua           Love2D configuration (window size, title)
    package.json       Project dependencies and scripts

Dependencies installed:
  react ^18.3.0
  react-reconciler ^0.29.0
  esbuild ^0.24.0 (dev)
  @types/react ^18.3.0 (dev)
  typescript ^5.5.0 (dev)

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Create a new project
---
ilovereact init my-game
cd my-game
ilovereact dev
---
Platforms: love2d

Example 2: Create and immediately build
---
ilovereact init dashboard
cd dashboard
ilovereact build dist:love
---
Platforms: love2d

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
The init command currently scaffolds for the Love2D target. The project structure includes
the Lua runtime and QuickJS FFI bridge needed for Love2D rendering. For grid targets
(terminal, Neovim, etc.), you would add the appropriate entry point and dependencies
manually after initialization.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- The project name becomes the directory name -- it must not already exist
- The CLI runtime directory must be populated first (run `make cli-setup` in the monorepo root)
- If the runtime is missing, init will warn but still create the project structure
- Never manually create project directories with mkdir + cp -- always use init
- Project files (src/, main.lua, conf.lua) are yours to edit. Framework files (lua/, lib/, ilovereact/) are managed by the CLI and will be overwritten by `ilovereact update`

- update.txt -- Sync framework files after changes
- build.txt -- Build for distribution
