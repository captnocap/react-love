description: Start esbuild in watch mode for live Love2D development.
category: CLI
platforms: love2d
keywords: dev, watch, hmr, live reload, esbuild, development
related: build.txt, init.txt
difficulty: beginner

=== OVERVIEW ===
The `ilovereact dev` command starts esbuild in watch mode, continuously rebuilding the
JavaScript bundle whenever source files change. It uses the correct esbuild flags for the
Love2D target (IIFE format, ReactLove global name, ES2020 target, automatic JSX).

Run `love .` in a separate terminal to see your app. Love2D reads the bundle.js file on
each frame update, so changes appear in real time without restarting Love2D.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Usage:
  ilovereact dev

Entry point:
  src/main.tsx (required -- the command exits with an error if this file does not exist)

Output:
  bundle.js in the project root

esbuild flags used:
  --bundle
  --format=iife
  --global-name=ReactLove
  --target=es2020
  --jsx=automatic
  --outfile=bundle.js
  --watch

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Standard development workflow
---
# Terminal 1:
cd my-project
ilovereact dev

# Terminal 2:
cd my-project
love .
---
Platforms: love2d

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
This command is specific to the Love2D target. It produces an IIFE bundle that runs inside
QuickJS via the Love2D bridge. For grid target development (terminal, Neovim, etc.), use
the npm scripts in the monorepo root package.json instead.

The dev command does not run the linter automatically. Run `ilovereact lint` separately
after making component changes.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- The project must have a src/main.tsx entry point
- Do NOT run raw esbuild --watch manually -- the CLI encodes the correct flags
- The dev command requires local lua/ and lib/ directories (run `ilovereact update` first if missing)
- Love2D must be running in a separate terminal -- the dev command only watches and bundles JS
- Ctrl+C exits the watcher

=== SEE ALSO ===
- build.txt -- Production builds (includes lint gate)
- lint.txt -- Run the linter separately during development
- init.txt -- Creating new projects with the correct structure
