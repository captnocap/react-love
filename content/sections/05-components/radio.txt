=== OVERVIEW ===
Radio and RadioGroup work together for exclusive selection. RadioGroup wraps a set of Radio components and provides shared context so that selecting one Radio automatically deselects the others.

RadioGroup supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes. In controlled mode, pass `value` and respond to `onValueChange`. In uncontrolled mode, optionally set `defaultValue`. Each Radio reads the group state from React context and renders a circular indicator that fills when its value matches the group's selected value.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Import: import { Radio, RadioGroup } from '@ilovereact/core';

Usage:
```tsx
<RadioGroup value={selected} onValueChange={setSelected}>
  <Radio value="a" label="Option A" />
  <Radio value="b" label="Option B" />
  <Radio value="c" label="Option C" />
</RadioGroup>
```

RadioGroup Props:

| Prop          | Type                      | Default | Description                                |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| value         | string                    | -       | Controlled selected value                  |
| defaultValue  | string                    | -       | Initial value in uncontrolled mode         |
| onValueChange | (value: string) => void   | -       | Called when selection changes               |
| disabled      | boolean                   | false   | Disables all Radio children                |
| children      | ReactNode                 | -       | Radio components (required)                |
| style         | Style                     | -       | Container style overrides                  |

Radio Props:

| Prop           | Type    | Default    | Description                               |
|----------------|---------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| value          | string  | (required) | Value this radio represents               |
| label          | string  | -          | Text label rendered beside the circle     |
| disabled       | boolean | false      | Disables this specific radio              |
| size           | number  | 20         | Circle diameter in pixels                 |
| color          | Color   | '#3b82f6'  | Border and inner dot color when selected  |
| uncheckedColor | Color   | '#6b7280'  | Border color when not selected            |
| style          | Style   | -          | Container style overrides                 |

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Controlled radio group
---
```tsx
const [plan, setPlan] = useState('free');

<RadioGroup value={plan} onValueChange={setPlan}>
  <Radio value="free" label="Free" />
  <Radio value="pro" label="Pro" />
  <Radio value="enterprise" label="Enterprise" />
</RadioGroup>
```

Example 2: Uncontrolled with custom styling
---
```tsx
<RadioGroup defaultValue="dark">
  <Radio value="light" label="Light" color="#f59e0b" size={24} />
  <Radio value="dark" label="Dark" color="#f59e0b" size={24} />
</RadioGroup>
```

Platforms: All

Example 3: Disabled group
---
```tsx
<RadioGroup value="locked" disabled>
  <Radio value="locked" label="Locked option" />
  <Radio value="other" label="Other option" />
</RadioGroup>
```

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
- Web: RadioGroup renders as a `<div>` with `flexDirection: 'column'` and `gap: 8`. Each Radio renders as a `<div>` row. Cursor changes to `not-allowed` when disabled.
- Native (Love2D): RadioGroup renders as a `Box` with `gap: 8`. Each Radio renders as a `Box` row with a circular border and an inner filled circle when selected.
- A Radio is disabled if either its own `disabled` prop is true OR the parent RadioGroup's `disabled` prop is true.
- The inner dot size is `Math.round(size * 0.5)`.
- The border width is `Math.max(2, Math.round(size / 10))`.
- Radio must be a child of RadioGroup. Without a RadioGroup parent, clicking a Radio does nothing (the group context is null).
- Label text color is `#e2e8f0` at `fontSize: 14`, with `gap: 8` between circle and label.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Radio MUST be wrapped in a RadioGroup. A Radio rendered outside a RadioGroup will not respond to clicks.
- The `value` prop on Radio is required and must be a string. It identifies which option this Radio represents within the group.
- In controlled mode, the RadioGroup does not update its selection unless the parent updates the `value` prop in response to `onValueChange`.
