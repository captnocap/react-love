=== OVERVIEW ===
Switch is a toggle control that slides a thumb along a track to indicate an on/off state. The track changes color based on the current value, and the thumb moves to the left (off) or right (on) edge.

Switch supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes. In controlled mode, pass `value` and respond to `onValueChange`. In uncontrolled mode, omit `value` and optionally set `defaultValue`. On web, the thumb animates with a CSS transition. In native mode, the thumb position is driven by flexbox `justifyContent`.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Import: import { Switch } from '@ilovereact/core';

Usage:
```tsx
<Switch
  value={isEnabled}
  onValueChange={(v) => setIsEnabled(v)}
  trackColor={{ true: '#81b0ff', false: '#767577' }}
/>
```

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Basic controlled switch
---
```tsx
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);

<Switch value={enabled} onValueChange={setEnabled} />
```

Platforms: All

Example 2: Uncontrolled with custom colors
---
```tsx
<Switch
  defaultValue={true}
  trackColor={{ true: '#4ade80', false: '#ef4444' }}
  thumbColor="#ffffff"
  width={60}
  height={32}
/>
```
---
Platforms: All

Example 3: Disabled switch
---
```tsx
<Switch value={true} disabled />
```
---
Platforms: All

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
- Web: Renders as nested `<div>` elements. The thumb uses `transition: left 0.2s ease` for smooth animation. Cursor changes to `not-allowed` when disabled.
- Native (Love2D): Uses `Box` with `flexDirection: 'row'` and `justifyContent` set to `'end'` (on) or `'start'` (off) to position the thumb. No CSS transitions; position changes are instant unless combined with the animation system.
- The thumb diameter is calculated as `height - 4` (2px padding on each side).
- The border radius of the track is `height / 2`, creating a pill shape.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Switch has a fixed pixel size. It does not stretch to fill its container by default. The `width` and `height` props control the track dimensions directly.
- When `disabled` is true, opacity is set to 0.5 and click/toggle events are ignored.
- In controlled mode, the component does not update visually unless the parent updates the `value` prop in response to `onValueChange`.
