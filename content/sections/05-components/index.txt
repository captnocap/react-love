=== OVERVIEW ===
iLoveReact ships a set of universal primitives and higher-level components that work across all render targets. Every visible element on screen is built from these building blocks. Primitives are the lowest-level elements (Box, Text, Image) that map directly to host elements in each target. Components are composed from primitives and provide richer interaction patterns (Pressable, ScrollView, Modal, Slider, and others).

All primitives and components are exported from `@ilovereact/core`. Grid targets (terminal, ComputerCraft, Neovim, Hammerspoon, AwesomeWM) use lowercase JSX intrinsics (`<view>`, `<text>`) and typically define local wrapper components; the `@ilovereact/core` exports target Love2D and web renderers.

=== COMPONENT INDEX ===

Primitives (layout building blocks):
  Box        - Flexbox layout container. Every UI tree starts here.
  Text       - Renders text content with font styling.
  Image      - Displays images with sizing and objectFit control.

Interaction:
  Pressable  - Interaction wrapper with press, long press, and hover state tracking.
  ScrollView - Scrollable container with imperative scrollTo API.
  Modal      - Fullscreen overlay with backdrop, animations, and dismiss handling.
  Slider     - Draggable range input with track and thumb.

Text Display:
  CodeBlock  - Syntax-highlighted code display (Lua-owned on Love2D, <pre> on web).

Form Primitives:
  TextInput  - Single-line and multiline text entry.
  TextEditor - Multi-line code/document editor with line numbers (Lua-owned).
  Checkbox   - Toggle checkbox with label support.
  Radio      - Radio button; use with RadioGroup for mutual exclusion.
  RadioGroup - Groups Radio buttons for single-selection behavior.
  Select     - Dropdown selector with option list.
  Switch     - Toggle switch with on/off states.

Layout Helpers:
  FlexRow    - Shorthand for Box with flexDirection: 'row'.
  FlexColumn - Shorthand for Box with flexDirection: 'column'.
  Spacer     - Flexible or fixed-size empty space.
  Card       - Styled container with background, padding, border radius, and shadow.
  Badge      - Small label for status indicators or counts.
  Divider    - Horizontal or vertical line separator.

Navigation:
  NavPanel    - Sidebar navigation with sections and items.
  Tabs        - Tabbed content switcher.
  Breadcrumbs - Hierarchical path trail.
  Toolbar     - Horizontal button/action bar.

Data Visualization:
  Table       - Tabular data display with columns and rows.
  BarChart    - Horizontal or vertical bar chart.
  ProgressBar - Determinate or indeterminate progress indicator.
  Sparkline   - Inline mini line chart.
  FlatList    - Virtualized list for large datasets.

Portal System:
  Portal     - Renders children into a PortalHost outside the normal tree.
  PortalHost - Mounting point for Portal content (used by Modal internally).

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Love2D:
  All components render as string-typed host elements ('View', 'Text', 'Image') processed by the Lua layout engine and painter. Flexbox is computed by layout.lua. Events go through bridge_quickjs.lua.

Web:
  Primitives render as DOM elements (div, span, img) with CSS flexbox. Interaction events use standard DOM event listeners. Styles are converted from the Style type to React.CSSProperties by styleToCSS().

Terminal / Grid targets:
  Use lowercase intrinsics (<view>, <text>) with the grid layout engine. The @ilovereact/core components are not used directly; grid targets have their own component wrappers built on @ilovereact/grid.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Always import from '@ilovereact/core', never from internal package paths
- Every <Text> must have an explicit fontSize -- the linter will block your build otherwise
- Root containers need width: '100%' and height: '100%', not flexGrow: 1
- Grid targets use different primitives; do not import @ilovereact/core components into grid-target code
- Run `ilovereact lint` after any component change to catch layout violations early
