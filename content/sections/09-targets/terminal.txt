title: Terminal Target
description: Pure JavaScript terminal renderer using ANSI truecolor escape sequences
category: Targets
platforms: terminal

difficulty: intermediate

=== OVERVIEW ===
The terminal target (@ilovereact/terminal) renders iLoveReact components to a terminal
emulator using ANSI truecolor escape sequences. The layout is computed by the grid
layout engine (@ilovereact/grid), which maps flexbox concepts to a character-cell grid.
Each cell contains a single character with foreground and background colors.

This target runs as a Node.js process and writes directly to stdout. It requires a
terminal with truecolor support (24-bit color), which most modern terminals provide.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
esbuild Configuration:
  --platform=node
  --format=esm

Build Commands:
  npm run build:terminal-demo       - Build terminal demo
  ilovereact build dist:terminal    - Single-file Node.js executable

Grid Target Primitives:
  Terminal targets use lowercase JSX intrinsics:
    <view>  - Container element (equivalent to Box)
    <text>  - Text element (equivalent to Text)

  Define local wrappers for the standard Box/Text API:
    function Box(props) { return <view {...props} />; }
    function Text(props) { return <text {...props} />; }

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Terminal App Entry Point
---
import { createTerminalApp } from '@ilovereact/terminal';
import App from './App';

const app = createTerminalApp();
app.render(<App />);
---
Platforms: terminal

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Constraints:
  - Character grid: no sub-pixel rendering, all positions snap to character cells
  - Dimensions are measured in characters, not pixels
  - Limited to what the terminal can display (no images, no gradients)
  - Color depends on terminal support (truecolor preferred, fallback to 256)
  - Input is keyboard-only in most terminals (no mouse by default)

Distribution:
  - `ilovereact build dist:terminal` produces a single-file Node.js executable
  - The output can be run with `node dist/main.js`
  - No system dependencies beyond Node.js
