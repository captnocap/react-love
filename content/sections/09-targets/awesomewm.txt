=== OVERVIEW ===
The AwesomeWM target (@ilovereact/awesome) renders iLoveReact components as widgets in
the Awesome tiling window manager on Linux. Rendering uses Cairo for 2D graphics and
Pango for text shaping, giving high-quality output with full antialiasing.
Communication happens via stdio between the Node.js process and the AwesomeWM Lua
runtime.

This target lets you build status bars, notification panels, system dashboards, or any
custom widget that integrates into your AwesomeWM desktop.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
esbuild Configuration:
  --platform=node
  --format=esm

Requirements:
  AwesomeWM running on Linux.
  The Node.js process is spawned by AwesomeWM and communicates via stdio.

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: AwesomeWM Widget Entry Point
---
import { createAwesomeApp } from '@ilovereact/awesome';
import App from './App';

const app = createAwesomeApp();
app.render(<App />);
---
Platforms: awesome

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Cairo/Pango rendering provides:
  - Antialiased vector graphics
  - High-quality text rendering with full Unicode support
  - Truecolor support
  - Sub-pixel positioning

This is the highest-quality text rendering target thanks to Pango's text
shaping. Cairo provides smooth curves and antialiasing for rounded corners
and other vector shapes.

Linux only. Requires AwesomeWM as the window manager.
