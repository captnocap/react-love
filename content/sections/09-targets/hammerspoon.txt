difficulty: intermediate

=== OVERVIEW ===
The Hammerspoon target (@ilovereact/hs) renders iLoveReact components as pixel-perfect
overlays on macOS using Hammerspoon's hs.canvas API. Communication happens over
WebSocket between the Node.js process (running your React app) and the Hammerspoon Lua
runtime. This lets you build rich floating dashboards, HUDs, or status panels that
render directly on your macOS desktop.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
esbuild Configuration:
  --platform=node
  --format=esm
  --external:ws

Requirements:
  Hammerspoon installed on macOS.
  WebSocket connection from Hammerspoon Lua to the Node.js server.

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Hammerspoon App Entry Point
---
import { createHSApp } from '@ilovereact/hs';
import App from './App';

const app = createHSApp({
  port: 9090,  // WebSocket port
});

app.render(<App />);
---
Platforms: hs

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Hammerspoon's hs.canvas provides:
  - Pixel-level rendering (rectangles, text, images)
  - Truecolor support
  - Mouse and keyboard event handling
  - Window-level compositing on macOS

This is one of the higher-fidelity targets, closer to Love2D than the character-grid
targets. The main constraint is that rendering is done through Hammerspoon's canvas
API rather than direct OpenGL calls, so performance may differ from Love2D.

macOS only. Requires Hammerspoon to be running.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Always include --external:ws in the esbuild configuration.
- The Hammerspoon Lua side must initiate the WebSocket connection.
