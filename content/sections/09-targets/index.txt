=== OVERVIEW ===
iLoveReact renders to seven distinct targets. Each target has its own painter, transport
mechanism, and build configuration. The core component API (Box, Text, Image, Pressable,
and all higher-level components) works across all of them. The differences are in
rendering fidelity, color support, input capabilities, and distribution format.

Choose your target based on your deployment environment. Love2D is the primary target
with the most features. Web mode runs in browsers. The grid targets (terminal, CC,
Neovim, HS, Awesome) operate on character grids or pixel canvases within their host
applications.
