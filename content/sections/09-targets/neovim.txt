difficulty: intermediate

=== OVERVIEW ===
The Neovim target (@ilovereact/nvim) renders iLoveReact components as Neovim floating
windows. Communication happens via stdio using the neovim npm package. The grid layout
engine computes character-cell positions, and the painter creates and updates floating
windows with the appropriate content and highlight groups.

This target lets you build rich UI panels, dashboards, or interactive tools that run
directly inside your Neovim editor.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
esbuild Configuration:
  --platform=node
  --format=esm

Requirements:
  Neovim 0.7+ with the `neovim` npm package installed.
  Communication via stdio (the Node.js process is spawned by Neovim).

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Neovim Plugin Entry Point
---
import { createNvimApp } from '@ilovereact/nvim';
import App from './App';

const app = createNvimApp();
app.render(<App />);
---
Platforms: nvim

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Neovim floating windows support:
  - Text content with highlight groups for coloring
  - Borders (single, double, rounded, etc.)
  - Positioning relative to the editor window
  - Transparency via winblend option

Limitations:
  - No pixel-level rendering (character grid only)
  - Colors limited to Neovim's highlight group system
  - Input is primarily keyboard-driven (Neovim key mappings)
  - Window management is constrained by Neovim's floating window API
