=== OVERVIEW ===
The ComputerCraft target (@ilovereact/cc) renders iLoveReact components inside Minecraft
via the ComputerCraft: Tweaked mod. The CC terminal provides a 51x19 character display
with a fixed 16-color palette. Communication between the Node.js process (running your
React app) and the in-game terminal happens over WebSocket.

This is the most constrained target in terms of display capabilities, but it
demonstrates the framework's multi-target architecture: the same React component model
works even on a 16-color 51x19 character grid inside a video game.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
esbuild Configuration:
  --platform=node
  --format=esm
  --external:ws

Display Constraints:
  Width:  51 characters
  Height: 19 characters
  Colors: 16 (CC palette: white, orange, magenta, lightBlue, yellow, lime,
          pink, gray, lightGray, cyan, purple, blue, brown, green, red, black)

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: CC App Setup
---
import { createCCApp } from '@ilovereact/cc';
import App from './App';

const app = createCCApp({
  port: 8080,  // WebSocket port for CC to connect to
});

app.render(<App />);
---
Platforms: cc

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
The WebSocket bridge requires the CC computer to connect to your Node.js server.
In-game, the CC Lua script opens a WebSocket connection and forwards terminal
events (key presses, mouse clicks) back to the Node.js process.

Colors are mapped from truecolor to the nearest CC palette entry. Detailed
color accuracy is limited by the 16-color constraint.

Text is rendered character-by-character into the CC terminal buffer. The grid
layout engine handles positioning within the 51x19 grid.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Always include --external:ws in the esbuild configuration. The ws package
  uses native Node.js modules that cannot be bundled.
- Design for the 51x19 grid. Components that work on larger displays will
  overflow or truncate on CC terminals.
- Use the 16-color palette consciously. Subtle color differences will be
  lost when mapped to the nearest palette entry.
