=== OVERVIEW ===
This page answers the most frequently asked questions about iLoveReact. If your question
is not here, check the common errors page for specific error symptoms, or the debugging
page for runtime investigation tools.

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Can I use npm packages?
---
Q: Can I install and use npm packages in my iLoveReact app?

A: Yes. Your src/ directory is a standard TypeScript/React project. Install packages
with `npm install` and import them normally. The esbuild bundler resolves and bundles
npm dependencies into the output.

Note: For the Love2D target, the bundle runs inside QuickJS, which has no Node.js
APIs (no fs, no http, no child_process). Pure JavaScript packages work. Packages
that depend on Node.js built-ins will not work in Love2D native mode but will work
in web mode or grid targets (which run on Node.js).

Example 2: How do I debug on Love2D?
---
Q: How do I inspect my UI layout at runtime on Love2D?

A: Press F12 to open the visual inspector. It overlays node boundaries, computed
dimensions, and style properties on your live UI. Move your mouse over elements to
see their layout data. Press F12 again to close.

For evaluating expressions at runtime, press the backtick key (`) to open the
interactive console. Type JavaScript expressions and see results inline.

Example 3: How does hot reload work?
---
Q: How do I see my changes without restarting Love2D?

A: Use `ilovereact dev` in one terminal (watch mode, rebuilds bundle.js on change)
and `love .` in another terminal. The Lua runtime polls bundle.js every ~1 second.
When it detects a change, it:
  1. Reads dev state from JS (__getDevState)
  2. Destroys the QuickJS context
  3. Clears all Lua-side state (tree, images, animations, hover, focus)
  4. Creates a new QuickJS context
  5. Loads the new bundle
  6. Injects cached dev state (__devState)
  7. Triggers mount

This gives you near-instant reload without restarting Love2D.

Example 4: What React version is required?
---
Q: What version of React does iLoveReact use?

A: React 18.3+ with react-reconciler 0.29. The reconciler version must match
the React version. iLoveReact uses React's concurrent features where applicable.
---
Platforms: All

Example 5: Can I use CSS?
---
Q: Can I use CSS stylesheets, CSS modules, or Tailwind CSS?

A: No. iLoveReact uses Style objects with flexbox properties, not CSS. The Style
interface is defined in TypeScript and supports a subset of CSS flexbox properties
plus custom properties for the target renderers.

In web mode, Style objects are converted to React CSSProperties by the styleToCSS()
function. But you write Style objects, not CSS.

There is no CSS cascade, no class selectors, no media queries, and no CSS variables.
All styling is explicit and co-located with components.

Example 6: How does text measurement work?
---
Q: How does iLoveReact know how wide text is?

A: On Love2D, text measurement uses Love2D's font:getWrap() and font:getWidth()
APIs. The measure.lua module loads fonts by (size, family, weight) and caches
them. When the layout engine encounters a Text node without explicit dimensions,
it calls measureText() to get the intrinsic width and height based on the font
metrics and the available width constraint.

On web, the browser's own text measurement is used (via CSS).

On grid targets, text width equals the character count (monospace grids).

Example 7: Can I mix targets?
---
Q: Can I render the same component to multiple targets simultaneously?

A: Each build is target-specific. You cannot render to Love2D and a terminal
from the same running process. However, shared components (those that only use
Box, Text, Pressable, and standard Style properties) work across all targets
without modification.

The recommended approach: write your components in a shared package, then
create target-specific entry points that import and render them.
