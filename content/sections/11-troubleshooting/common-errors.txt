=== OVERVIEW ===
This page lists the most common errors and unexpected behaviors in iLoveReact, organized
by symptom. Each entry explains why the problem occurs and how to fix it. Most of these
are caught by the static linter (`ilovereact lint`), so running the linter after every
component change is the fastest way to avoid them.

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Text Not Rendering
---
Symptom: A <Text> component exists in the tree but nothing appears on screen.

Cause: The Text node is missing an explicit fontSize.
  Without fontSize, the layout engine uses a default of 14 but the linter
  will block your build. If you bypassed the linter, the text may render
  at an unexpected size or position.

Fix: Always provide fontSize on every Text node.

  BAD:  <Text style={{ color: '#ffffff' }}>Hello</Text>
  GOOD: <Text style={{ fontSize: 16, color: '#ffffff' }}>Hello</Text>

The linter rule `no-missing-font-size` enforces this.

Example 2: flexGrow Not Working
---
Symptom: A node has flexGrow: 1 but does not expand to fill space.

Cause: The parent does not have a known size on the main axis.
  flexGrow distributes free space. If the parent's size is auto (unknown),
  there is no free space to distribute.

Fix: Give the parent an explicit size.

  BAD:
  <Box>
    <Box style={{ flexGrow: 1 }} />  {/* Parent has no height */}
  </Box>

  GOOD:
  <Box style={{ height: '100%' }}>
    <Box style={{ flexGrow: 1 }} />  {/* Parent has known height */}
  </Box>

For the root container, always use width: '100%', height: '100%'.
Do NOT use flexGrow: 1 on root containers.

Platforms: All

Example 3: justifyContent Ignored on Row
---
Symptom: A row Box has justifyContent: 'center' but children are left-aligned.

Cause: The row Box has no explicit width. Box nodes have no intrinsic width
  (only Text nodes do via measurement). Without a known width, there is no
  space to distribute, so justifyContent has no effect.

Fix: Add width: '100%' or a fixed width to row Boxes that need justifyContent.

  BAD:
  <Box style={{ flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Text style={{ fontSize: 14 }}>Centered?</Text>
  </Box>

  GOOD:
  <Box style={{ flexDirection: 'row', width: '100%', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Text style={{ fontSize: 14 }}>Centered!</Text>
  </Box>

Platforms: All

Example 4: Mixed Text Children
---
Symptom: Text content renders incorrectly or only partially.

Cause: Using mixed JSX expressions in Text creates multiple child nodes
  instead of a single text string.

Fix: Use template literals for dynamic text content.

  BAD:  <Text style={{ fontSize: 14 }}>Count: {count}</Text>
  GOOD: <Text style={{ fontSize: 14 }}>{`Count: ${count}`}</Text>
---
Platforms: All

Example 5: Build Fails
---
Symptom: `ilovereact build` exits with errors.

Cause: The build command runs `ilovereact lint` as a gate before bundling.
  Layout lint errors will block the build.

Fix: Run `ilovereact lint` separately to see all errors. Fix each one.
  Common lint errors:
  - no-missing-font-size: Text without fontSize
  - no-block-char-in-text: Unicode block character in Text (use Box with backgroundColor)
  - root container without 100% dimensions

If a lint rule is wrong for your use case, use the escape hatch:
  // ilr-ignore-next-line

Platforms: All

Example 6: Runtime Files Outdated
---
Symptom: After editing framework files (lua/*.lua, packages/shared/), the changes
  do not appear in your project.

Cause: You edited the source of truth but did not run the sync pipeline.
  The project still has the old copies.

Fix: Run the full sync pipeline.

  make cli-setup              # source -> cli/runtime/
  cd examples/<project>
  ilovereact update           # cli/runtime/ -> project copies
  ilovereact build dist:love  # rebuild
---
Platforms: All

Example 7: libquickjs.so Not Found
---
Symptom: Love2D crashes with an error about loading libquickjs.so.

Cause: The QuickJS shared library has not been built or is not in the
  expected location.

Fix: Build QuickJS and sync to the project.

  make setup       # Clone quickjs-ng, compile libquickjs.so
  make cli-setup   # Copy to cli/runtime/lib/
  cd examples/<project>
  ilovereact update  # Copy to project/lib/

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Run `ilovereact lint` after EVERY component change.
- The linter catches the most common errors before they become runtime bugs.
- When in doubt, check the computed layout with the F12 inspector.
- If changes are not appearing, check whether you edited the source of truth
  or a copy.
