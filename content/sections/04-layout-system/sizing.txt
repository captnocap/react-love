=== OVERVIEW ===
Every element in iLoveReact has explicit sizing control through width, height, and their
min/max variants. Values can be numbers (interpreted as pixels on Love2D/web, or character
cells on grid targets) or percentage strings like '100%' or '50%'. Unlike the web, Box
elements in iLoveReact have no intrinsic width -- if you do not specify a width, it is
effectively zero unless flexGrow or alignItems: 'stretch' provides one.

Root containers must always use width: '100%', height: '100%' to fill the viewport. This
is the most common mistake in iLoveReact development and is enforced by the linter. Using
flexGrow: 1 on the root does not work because there is no parent container to grow into.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Sizing style properties:

  width: number | string
    Width in pixels (number) or percentage of parent ('50%', '100%').
    Box nodes have zero intrinsic width. Text nodes have intrinsic width from font measurement.

  height: number | string
    Height in pixels (number) or percentage of parent.
    Box nodes have zero intrinsic height. Text nodes have intrinsic height from fontSize.

  minWidth: number | string
    Minimum width constraint. The element will not shrink below this value.

  minHeight: number | string
    Minimum height constraint.

  maxWidth: number | string
    Maximum width constraint. The element will not grow beyond this value.

  maxHeight: number | string
    Maximum height constraint.

  aspectRatio: number
    Maintains a width-to-height ratio. For example, aspectRatio: 16/9 with width: 320
    produces height: 180. If only one dimension is set, the other is computed from the ratio.

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Root container filling viewport
---
<Box style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#1e1e2e' }}>
  <Text style={{ fontSize: 20, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>Full viewport</Text>
</Box>
---
Platforms: All

Example 2: Fixed-size box
---
<Box style={{ width: 200, height: 100, backgroundColor: '#89b4fa', borderRadius: 8 }} />
---
Platforms: All

Example 3: Percentage-based sizing
---
<Box style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}>
  <Box style={{ width: '50%', height: '30%', backgroundColor: '#a6e3a1' }} />
</Box>
---
Platforms: All

Example 4: Min/max constraints
---
<Box style={{
  width: '80%',
  minWidth: 200,
  maxWidth: 600,
  height: 100,
  backgroundColor: '#f9e2af',
}} />
---
Platforms: All

Example 5: Aspect ratio
---
<Box style={{
  width: 320,
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
  backgroundColor: '#cba6f7',
  borderRadius: 8,
}} />
---
Platforms: All

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Love2D: Pixel units. The canvas has a fixed resolution set in conf.lua (typically 1280x720
or 1920x1080). Percentage values are relative to the parent container's computed size.

Web: Maps directly to CSS width/height. Pixel values become CSS pixels. Percentage strings
pass through as-is.

Grid targets: Number values represent character cells, not pixels. A width of 40 means 40
characters wide. Percentage values work the same way -- relative to the parent's cell count.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Root containers MUST use width: '100%', height: '100%' -- NOT flexGrow: 1
- Box nodes have zero intrinsic width and height -- always specify dimensions or use flex sizing
- Text nodes have intrinsic dimensions based on fontSize and content -- but you still MUST set fontSize
- Pre-compute grid dimensions rather than relying on child content to infer container size
- Percentage values are relative to the parent's computed dimension, not the viewport (unless the parent is the root)
