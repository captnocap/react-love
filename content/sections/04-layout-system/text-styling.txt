=== OVERVIEW ===
The Text primitive has its own set of style properties for controlling typography. The most
important rule in iLoveReact is that every Text element MUST have an explicit fontSize in
its style. This is not optional -- the layout engine needs fontSize to measure text and
compute layout, and the linter will block builds that violate this rule.

Text styling covers font properties (size, family, weight), text layout (alignment,
overflow, line height, letter spacing), text decoration (underline, strikethrough), and
text shadow. Colors use the same Color type as visual styling (CSS strings or Love2D-style
arrays).

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Text style properties:

  color: Color
    Text color. Accepts CSS strings ("#cdd6f4") or Love2D arrays ([0.8, 0.84, 0.96]).

  fontSize: number (REQUIRED)
    Font size in pixels (Love2D/web) or character scale (grid targets).
    This property is MANDATORY on every Text element. The linter enforces this with the
    'no-text-without-fontsize' rule.

  fontFamily: string
    Font family name. On Love2D, this must be a font file available in the project.
    On web, it maps to CSS font-family.

  fontWeight: 'normal' | 'bold' | number
    Font weight. 'normal' is typically 400, 'bold' is 700. Numeric values (100-900)
    are supported on web and Love2D (if the font file supports weight variants).

  textAlign: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'
    Horizontal text alignment within the Text element's bounds.
    Default: 'left'

  textOverflow: 'clip' | 'ellipsis'
    How to handle text that overflows its container.
    'clip': text is cut off at the boundary.
    'ellipsis': text is truncated with "..." at the boundary.

  textDecorationLine: 'none' | 'underline' | 'line-through'
    Text decoration. 'underline' draws a line below the text, 'line-through' draws
    a line through the middle.

  lineHeight: number
    Line height in pixels. Controls the vertical spacing between lines of text.
    On web, this is converted to CSS line-height with 'px' units.

  letterSpacing: number
    Additional horizontal space between characters, in pixels.

  textShadowColor: Color
    Color of the text shadow. If not set, no text shadow is rendered.

  textShadowOffsetX: number
    Horizontal offset of the text shadow.

  textShadowOffsetY: number
    Vertical offset of the text shadow.

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Basic text with required fontSize
---
<Text style={{ fontSize: 16, color: '#cdd6f4' }}>Hello, world</Text>
---
Platforms: All

Example 2: Styled heading
---
<Text style={{
  fontSize: 32,
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  color: '#cba6f7',
  textAlign: 'center',
  letterSpacing: 2,
}}>
  Dashboard
</Text>
---
Platforms: All

Example 3: Text with decoration
---
<Text style={{
  fontSize: 14,
  color: '#a6adc8',
  textDecorationLine: 'underline',
}}>

Platforms: All

Example 4: Multiline text with lineHeight
---
<Text style={{
  fontSize: 14,
  color: '#cdd6f4',
  lineHeight: 22,
}}>
  {`This is a longer paragraph of text that demonstrates line height control. Each line has 22 pixels of vertical space.`}
</Text>
---
Platforms: All

Example 5: Text overflow with ellipsis
---
<Box style={{ width: 200 }}>
  <Text style={{
    fontSize: 14,
    color: '#cdd6f4',
    textOverflow: 'ellipsis',
  }}>
    {`This is a very long string that will be truncated with an ellipsis`}
  </Text>
</Box>
---
Platforms: All

Example 6: Text shadow
---
<Text style={{
  fontSize: 24,
  color: '#cdd6f4',
  textShadowColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)',
  textShadowOffsetX: 2,
  textShadowOffsetY: 2,
}}>
  Shadow Text
</Text>

Platforms: love2d, web

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Love2D: fontSize determines which Love2D Font object is used for rendering and measurement.
fontFamily must correspond to a .ttf or .otf file accessible to the Love2D application.
Text measurement is done via Love2D's Font:getWidth() and Font:getHeight() methods.

Web: Text style properties map directly to CSS equivalents. fontSize becomes CSS font-size
in pixels. lineHeight is converted to CSS with 'px' suffix. letterSpacing maps to CSS
letter-spacing.

Grid targets: fontSize is less meaningful in character-grid contexts -- text is always
rendered at one character per cell. However, it is still required by the style system
for consistency. fontWeight may map to bold terminal attributes where supported.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Every Text element MUST have explicit fontSize -- builds will fail without it (linter rule: no-text-without-fontsize)
- Do NOT mix literal text and JSX expressions in Text children -- use template literals instead (linter rule: no-mixed-text-children)
  WRONG: <Text style={{ fontSize: 14 }}>Score: {score}</Text>
  RIGHT: <Text style={{ fontSize: 14 }}>{`Score: ${score}`}</Text>
- Do NOT use the block character (U+2588) in Text elements -- it renders as a font glyph, not a filled pixel (linter rule: no-block-char-in-text)
- Text nodes have intrinsic dimensions from font measurement -- they do not need explicit width/height in most cases
