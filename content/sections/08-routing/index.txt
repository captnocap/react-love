=== OVERVIEW ===
iLoveReact includes a @ilovereact/router package for in-app navigation between screens.
Since there is no browser URL bar or history API in most targets, routing is purely
in-memory. The router manages a stack of screens and provides hooks for navigating
between them.

The router follows a simple pattern: define your screens as React components, register
them with the router, and use navigation hooks to push, pop, or replace screens.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Basic Usage Pattern:
  import { Router, Screen, useNavigation } from '@ilovereact/router';

  function App() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Screen name="home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Screen name="settings" component={SettingsScreen} />
      </Router>
    );
  }

  function HomeScreen() {
    const nav = useNavigation();
    return (
      <Pressable onPress={() => nav.push('settings')}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>Go to Settings</Text>
      </Pressable>
    );
  }
