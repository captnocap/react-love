=== OVERVIEW ===
iLoveReact is an npm workspaces monorepo. The core framework runs on Node.js for builds
and development tooling. The Love2D target additionally requires the Love2D runtime and
a compiled QuickJS shared library. This guide walks through every step from a fresh
clone to a verified installation.

Grid targets (terminal, ComputerCraft, Neovim, Hammerspoon, AwesomeWM) only need
Node.js. The Love2D target needs the full toolchain.

=== API / SYNTAX ===
Prerequisites:
  - Node.js 18+ and npm
  - Love2D 11+ (for Love2D target only)
  - make + gcc (for QuickJS compilation, Love2D target only)
  - git

=== EXAMPLES ===
Example 1: Full Installation (All Targets)
---
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> && cd react-love

# 2. Install npm dependencies (workspaces monorepo)
npm install

# 3. Build QuickJS shared library (needed for Love2D target)
#    Clones quickjs-ng and compiles libquickjs.so
make setup

# 4. Propagate source-of-truth files to CLI runtime
#    Copies lua/*.lua, packages/shared/, packages/native/, libquickjs.so
#    into cli/runtime/ so the CLI can scaffold projects
make cli-setup

# 5. Link the CLI globally
cd cli && npm link && cd ..

# 6. Verify the installation

Platforms: All

Example 2: Minimal Installation (Grid Targets Only)
---
# Grid targets (terminal, cc, nvim, hs, awesome) do not need Love2D or QuickJS

# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo-url> && cd react-love
npm install

# 2. Build a terminal demo directly
npm run build:terminal-demo

# 3. Run it
node examples/terminal-demo/dist/main.js

Platforms: terminal, cc, nvim, hs, awesome

=== PLATFORM NOTES ===
Love2D:
  - Install Love2D 11+ from https://love2d.org or your package manager.
  - On Linux: `sudo apt install love` or download the AppImage.
  - On macOS: `brew install love` or download from love2d.org.
  - The `make setup` step compiles libquickjs.so which requires a C compiler (gcc or clang).

Terminal:
  - Requires a terminal with truecolor support (most modern terminals).
  - No additional system dependencies beyond Node.js.

ComputerCraft:
  - Requires a running Minecraft instance with CC: Tweaked mod.
  - The WebSocket bridge connects to the CC terminal.

Neovim:
  - Requires Neovim 0.7+ with the `neovim` npm package.
  - Communication via stdio.

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Always run `make cli-setup` after pulling framework changes. This propagates
  source-of-truth files into the CLI runtime directory.
- Never edit files in cli/runtime/ directly. They are overwritten by make cli-setup.
- The `npm link` step in cli/ must be done once to make the `ilovereact` command
  available globally.
