=== OVERVIEW ===
Welcome to iLoveReact. This section covers everything you need to go from zero to a
running application. Whether you are targeting Love2D, a terminal emulator, Neovim, or
any other supported platform, the fundamentals are the same: install the toolchain,
scaffold a project, write React components, and build.

Start with the philosophy document to understand what iLoveReact is and how it differs
from browser-based React. Then follow the installation guide, run through the quick
start, and build your first interactive app.
