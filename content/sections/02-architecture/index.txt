=== OVERVIEW ===
iLoveReact's architecture is a multi-stage rendering pipeline. React components are
reconciled into an instance tree, serialized as mutation commands, transported to the
target runtime, laid out by a flexbox engine, and drawn by a target-specific painter.
Each stage is independent and replaceable.

This section documents each stage in detail, from the React reconciler through the
final paint calls. Understanding this pipeline is essential for debugging layout issues,
building custom targets, or contributing to the framework.
