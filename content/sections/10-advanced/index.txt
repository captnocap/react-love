difficulty: advanced

=== OVERVIEW ===
This section covers the internals of iLoveReact for developers who need to understand
what happens beneath the component API. Topics include the complete Lua runtime module
inventory, networking (HTTP, WebSockets, proxies), Tor integration, the event dispatch
system, performance optimization strategies, debugging tools, and how to create new
render targets.

These topics assume familiarity with the rendering pipeline (see 02-architecture/) and
the component API (see 05-components/).
