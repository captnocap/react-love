=== OVERVIEW ===
This section covers the internals of iLoveReact for developers who need to understand
what happens beneath the component API. Topics include the complete Lua runtime module
inventory, the event dispatch system, performance optimization strategies, debugging
tools, and how to create new render targets.

These topics assume familiarity with the rendering pipeline (see 02-architecture/) and
the component API (see 05-components/).
