platforms: all
keywords: hello world, beginner, basic, first app, centered text
difficulty: beginner

=== OVERVIEW ===
This example demonstrates the absolute minimum iLoveReact application: a single Text
node centered on a full-viewport Box. It covers the three essential concepts: importing
primitives, filling the viewport, and centering content with flexbox.

=== CODE ===
---
import { Box, Text } from '@ilovereact/core';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Box style={{
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      backgroundColor: '#0f172a',
      justifyContent: 'center',
      alignItems: 'center',
    }}>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 32, color: '#f8fafc' }}>
        Hello, iLoveReact!
      </Text>
    </Box>
  );
}
---

=== EXPLANATION ===
1. Import Box and Text from @ilovereact/core. These are the universal primitives
   that work on every target.

2. The root Box has width: '100%' and height: '100%'. This is required to fill the
   viewport. Without these, the root Box has zero size and nothing renders.

3. backgroundColor: '#0f172a' sets a dark blue background. Colors are CSS hex strings.

4. justifyContent: 'center' centers children along the main axis (vertical, because
   the default flexDirection is 'column').

5. alignItems: 'center' centers children along the cross axis (horizontal).

6. The Text node has an explicit fontSize: 32. Every Text node MUST have fontSize.
   This is enforced by the linter.

7. color: '#f8fafc' sets the text color to near-white.
